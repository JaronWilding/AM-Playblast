## Dev notes
This was created in response to QuickTime's bad implementation inside of Maya, with the first iteration just being inside of Python, and writing out frames as images.

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!

All code is freely available here to be used how you like, please put a note for anyone's code used!
